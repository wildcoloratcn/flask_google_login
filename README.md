# Google Login For Flask

There are many tutorials and libraries on Google Login with Flask. I've tried so many of them. But this one is neat, simple and it simply just works.

I put everything in one file for easy understanding.

## Usage

1. create virtual environment
2. install several required packages

```
pip install Flask Authlib
```

3. Copy your keys into the file
4. run with
```
python wsgi_google_login.py
```

- [ ] flask facebook login

## star project for future development
